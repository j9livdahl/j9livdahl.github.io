 		<h1><strong>Design Challenge #1</strong></h1>
 		<br>
 		<h2><strong>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</strong></h1>

 		<p>I chose <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/templates"> SquareSpace.com</a> because it doesn't get in the way of itself. The page is designed to get users to start creating websites (their product).</p>
 		
 		<p>I chose <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com"> LonelyPlanet.com</a> because they do a good job of balancing two needs: users who are travel dreaming and want to get lost in the content and users looking for very specific information.</p>
		<br>
 		<h2><strong>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</strong></h1>

 		<p>The strength of <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/templates"> SquareSpace.com</a> is the focal point "Choose Your Template" at the top of the page, which is emphasized with ample negative space. This combination leads the eye to the templates or their product. </p>
 		<br>

 		<p>Where <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/templates"> SquareSpace.com</a> uses design to encourage browsing of templates, <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com"> LonelyPlanet.com</a> uses design to convey lots of different travel products and advice. Instead of using one focal point, the index page is used as visual navigation to all the other pieces of content on the site. Designed responsively, the site's 8x3 grid turns into a 2x12 grid when viewed on a mobile device. In both views, all pieces of content are the same size, therefore attracting the same visual attention.</p>

 		<h2><strong>What makes them similar and different?</strong></h1>

 		<h4>A few similarities I dig:</h4>

 		 <ul>
 		 	<li>Layout encourages users to act in different ways</li>
 		 	<br>
 		 	<li>Both sites are responsive, but still keep their design point-of-view (for the most part...)</li>
 		 	<br>
 		 	<li>Grid-based layout</li>
 		 	<br>
 		 	<li>Content pieces are sized similarly on the page giving them the same relative importance</li>
 		 </ul>
 		 <br>
 		 <h4>A few differences I noticed:</h4>

 		 <ul>
 		 	<li>Square Space has a well-defined focal point</li>
 		 	<br>
 		 	<li>Square Space uses a lot of negative space at the top of the page to draw focus to the content underneath</li>
 		 	<br>
 		 	<li>Square Space does not have a clearly defined header drawing more attention to the center of the page</li>
 		 	<br>
 		 	<li>Lonely Planet page lacks a strong visual hierarchy giving all content pieces equal weight</li>
 		 	<br>
 		 	<li>Lonely Planet's navigation is multi-layered making it more confusing</li>
 		 </ul>
		<br>
 		<h2><strong>Thumbnail Sketches</strong></h1>
 		
 		<p>The site I would like to create is a shopping site aimed at putting the products on display.</p> 

		<h4><u>Index Page</u></h4>
 		<p>The index page focuses on three main images with the focal point being the larger image on the left-hand side. The main navigation is at the top of the page to provide more negative space and therefore draw more attention to the three products on the page.</p>

 		<h4><u>Product Page</u></h4>
 		<p>When a product is selected (noted in red) it becomes the primary image on the page. This is balanced by the item name, price, and description located to the right of the image. Arrows are provided for easy paths to different products. The header and logo remain unchanged to keep the design consistent from page to page.
 		<br>
 		<br>
 		Once the Add to Cart button is selected, the black Add to Cart button appears to the right of the header.</p>

 		<h4><u>Shop All Products</u></h4>
 		<p>This page allows users to quickly sort through products to find what they are looking for. The focal point remains on the products. A 2x2 grid shows the different products giving users the option to change the layout (the two cirlces located above the images). </p>
