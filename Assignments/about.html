 		<h1><strong>About Jeanine Livdahl</strong></h1>

 		<p>I'm a UX Researcher, living in Minneapolis, MN. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to transition from researching and critiquing designs to making them. I know a lot about user experience, but little about code and development. That's why I am here.</p>

 		<h2><strong>My Mission</strong></h2>

 		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one-day work as an information architect that dabbles in front-end development. I would like to work with small businesses because I believe smart, non-headache enducing design is for everyone.</p>
